					<p>I only wanted to have fun<br>
						Learning to fly, learning to run<br>
						I let my heart decide the way<br>
						When I was young<br>
						Deep down I must have always known<br>
						That is would be inevitable<br>
						To earn my stripes I'd have to pay<br>
						And bear my soul

					<p>[Chorus]<br>
						I know I'm not the only one<br>
						Who regrets the things they've done<br>
						Sometimes I just feel it's only me<br>
						Who can't stand the reflection that they see<br>
						I wish I could live a little more<br>
						Look up to the sky, not just the floor<br>
						I feel like my life is flashing by<br>
						And all I can do is watch and cry<br>
						I miss the air, I miss my friends<br>
						I miss my mother; I miss it when<br>
						Life was a party to be thrown<br>
						But that was a million years ago
